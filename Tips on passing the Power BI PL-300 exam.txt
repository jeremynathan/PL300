Taking the exam from home
Remove everything from your desk except one (1) monitor, keyboard, mouse and clear water container
Get in to the Certification Dashboard at least a half hour before your test begins to get a proctor
You scan the entire room with your webcam, show your sleeves, show your eye-glasses (if wearing)
Webcam takes a picture of your ID
Show your phone and put the phone behind your seat

Power BI PL-300: you have 180 minutes (I finished with 50 minutes to go) so relax, DO NOT HURRY
Read the entire question twice, don’t let them trip you up with all the words of the questions
5 sections:
The first section of questions is just a survey and does not count for your score
There were two case studies with about 5 questions each and then 39 questions after that
The case studies and about 3 other questions had more details on the right side of the screen
You don’t use the keyboard, just the mouse
Some questions were select two checkboxes for the two correct answers (1 point each)
Some questions were three steps that you had to slide to answer section and put in order
Some questions were drop-down lists such as completing DAX measures
